## Introduction
A computer network is a collection of computers and other hardware devices interconnected for communication and sharing resources.

## Network Types
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small geographical area, typically within a building or campus.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city.

## Network Topologies
- **Star**: Centralized network with devices connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Bus**: Devices connected linearly along a single backbone.
- **Ring**: Devices connected in a circular or ring configuration.
- **Mesh**: Devices interconnected with multiple redundant paths.

## Network Devices
- **Router**: Connects different networks and routes data packets between them.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a single network, forwarding data to specific devices.
- **Hub**: Basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN.
- **Modem**: Converts digital data from a computer to analog signals for transmission over telephone lines.

## Network Protocols
- **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, fundamental protocols for the internet.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure, for transferring web pages and data.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol, for file transfers between systems.
- **DNS**: Domain Name System, translates domain names to IP addresses.
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP**: Email protocols for sending and receiving emails.

## IP Addressing
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address to accommodate the growing number of devices (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

## Routing and Switching
- **Routing**: Process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic.
- **Switching**: Process of forwarding data packets between devices on the same network.

## Network Security
- **Firewall**: Filters network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Network, secures communication over a public network by encrypting data.
- **IDS/IPS**: Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System, monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential threats.

## Wireless Networking
- **Wi-Fi**: Wireless local area networking technology based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Bluetooth**: Short-range wireless technology for connecting devices over short distances.
- **NFC**: Near Field Communication, allows two devices to establish communication by bringing them close together.

## Network Performance
- **Bandwidth**: Maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection.
- **Latency**: Time delay between the moment data is sent and received.
- **Jitter**: Variability in latency, affecting audio and video quality in real-time applications.

## Network Management
- **SNMP**: Simple Network Management Protocol, monitors and manages network devices.
- **Syslog**: Standard for computer message logging, collecting and storing logs from various devices.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Software tools like Nagios, Zabbix for monitoring network performance and health.

## Cloud Networking
- **Virtualization**: Partitioning of physical servers into smaller virtual servers to maximize resources.
- **SDN**: Software-Defined Networking, where network control is decoupled from hardware.
- **Public/Private/Hybrid Cloud**: Different deployment models offering varying levels of control and security.
