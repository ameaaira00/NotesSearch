# Reviewer By Aira

Reviewer By Aira is a web application designed to help find specific information within markdown notes using natural language queries.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Reviewer-By-Aira
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (using venv):
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate the virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the `run_app.bat` script by double-clicking it or running:
     ```
     run_app.bat
     ```
   - This script activates a virtual environment, preprocesses markdown files, indexes documents, and starts the Flask web server.

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and go to the corresponding URL to use the application.

## Tools Used

Reviewer By Aira utilizes several tools and libraries for its functionality:

- **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework used for building the web application.
- **Python:** The programming language used for backend logic.
- **Annoy:** A library for approximate nearest neighbor indexing which helps in efficiently searching for similar documents.
- **Transformers (from Hugging Face):** Specifically `GPT2Tokenizer` and `GPT2Model`, used for tokenization and embedding generation.
- **PyTorch (torch):** An open-source machine learning library used for the deep learning models.
- **NumPy:** A library for numerical computations in Python.


## Files and Directories
- **Notes/:** Directory containing markdown files with notes on various topics.
- **templates/:** Directory containing HTML templates used by the Flask application.
- **venv/:** Virtual environment directory for Python dependencies.
- **app.py:** Main Flask application file handling web requests and responses.
- **index_documents.py:** Python script for indexing processed notes using Annoy.
- **preprocess_markdown.py:** Python script for preprocessing markdown files into JSON format.
- **requirements.txt:** File listing Python dependencies required to run the application.
- **run_app.bat:** Batch script to automate virtual environment activation, preprocessing, indexing, and starting the Flask app.

## Possible Improvements

### Enhancing Search Accuracy with Advanced Models

The current version of Reviewer By Aira utilizes the GPT-2 model for generating embeddings of notes and Annoy for efficient nearest neighbor search. While effective, there are opportunities to enhance search accuracy by exploring more advanced language models and indexing techniques.

#### Using Advanced Language Models

**What is a Language Model?**
A language model like GPT-2 is a type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language patterns. It's used here to interpret and match user queries with relevant sections from your notes.

**Why Consider Better Models?**
GPT-2, though powerful, may sometimes struggle with specific queries due to its training limitations or the complexity of the search task. Upgrading to more recent models like GPT-3 or transformer architectures fine-tuned on domain-specific data could potentially improve the relevance and accuracy of search results.

#### Exploring Alternative Indexing Methods

**Annoy Indexing Overview**
Annoy is used to quickly find the nearest neighbors (i.e., similar notes) based on embeddings generated by GPT-2. It's efficient but may not always rank results optimally for complex queries or edge cases.

**Potential Future Enhancements**
Exploring alternatives to Annoy, such as FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) or HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs), could potentially yield better search performance by improving how similarities between notes are measured and ranked.


## Lessons Learned

- **Application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Information Retrieval**
  - Understanding NLP concepts and practical applications.
  - Tokenization, text embedding, and semantic similarity using GPT-2.
  
- **Implementing Efficient Search with Annoy Index**
